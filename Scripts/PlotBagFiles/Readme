These scripts allow you to debug and read data from ROS bag files. 
To use:
first, convert the .bag file to a .pickle file (this makes it faster to work with the files): 
  python convertToPickle.py MY_BAG_FILE.bag
where MY_BAG_FILE.bag is the bag file you created with `rosbag record`

This will create a file called MY_BAG_FILE.pickle

You can now read this with a python script, and plot quantities of interest. Some example scripts are given:
* ratesControl: plot data relevant to debugging issues with the rates control
* imuSensors: plots the rate gyro and accelerometer data
* moCap: plot data from the mocap, and from the estimator

The script `printKeys` can be run on a bag file to tell you what the data is which you can plot. 

Note: You will need to install py3dmath to get this working. Install it from here: https://github.com/muellerlab/py3dmath
